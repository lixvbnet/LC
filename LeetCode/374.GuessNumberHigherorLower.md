## [374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)


We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

- `-1`: My picked number is lower than your guess (i.e. `pick < num`).
- `1`: My picked number is higher than your guess (i.e. `pick > num`).
- `0`: My picked number is equal to your guess (i.e. `pick == num`).

==Updated the above description to reduce confusion!== 

Return _the number that I picked_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>
*   `1 <= pick <= n`



## Solution

```go
// pre-definied API
// num: your guess
// returns -1       if pick < num
//          1       if pick > num
//          0       if pick == num
// func guess(num int) int

func guessNumber(n int) int {
    l, r := 1, n
    for l <= r {
        m := l + (r - l) / 2
        res := guess(m)
        if res == 0 {
            return m
        } else if res < 0 {     // pick < m
            r = m - 1
        } else {                // pick > m
            l = m + 1
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```

## [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)


Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 300`
*   `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

## Solution

- Counting sort (Two-pass)

```go
func sortColors(nums []int) {
    var count [3]int
    for _, v := range nums {
        count[v]++
    }
    
    index := 0
    for color := range count {
        for i := 0; i < count[color]; i++ {
            nums[index] = color
            index++
        }
    }
}
```

- Two pointers (One-pass)

```go
func sortColors(nums []int) {
    l, r := 0, len(nums)-1
    
    i := 0
    for i <= r {
        if nums[i] == 0 {
            nums[l], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[l]
            l++
            i++
        } else if nums[i] == 2 {
            nums[i], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[i]
            r--		// don't increament i here, as nums[r] might be 0.
        } else {
            i++
        }
    }
}
```

> Note that we do NOT increment `i` when `nums[i] == 2` , as `nums[r]` might be 0 and we would need to double-check in next round if it needs to be swapped to the front.

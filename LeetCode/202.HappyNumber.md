## [202. Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)


Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

*   Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
*   Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
*   Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` _if_ `n` _is a happy number, and_ `false` _if not_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>



## Solution

- HashMap	$Time: O(logn), Space: O(logn)$ 

> Eventually, it either reaches to 1 OR enter a loop (cycle of numbers).

```go
func isHappy(n int) bool {
    m := make(map[int]bool)
    for n != 1 && !m[n] {
        m[n] = true
        n = next(n)
    }
    return n == 1
}

func next(n int) int {
    sum := 0
    for n > 0 {
        digit := n%10
        sum += digit * digit
        n /= 10
    }
    return sum
}
```



- Slow and Fast Pointers	$Time: O(logn), Space: O(1)$ 

> It is in fact "cycle detection for LinkedList".

```go
func isHappy(n int) bool {
    slow, fast := n, next(n)
    for fast != 1 && slow != fast {
        slow = next(slow)
        fast = next(next(fast))
    }
    return fast == 1
}

func next(n int) int {
    sum := 0
    for n > 0 {
        digit := n%10
        sum += digit * digit
        n /= 10
    }
    return sum
}
```

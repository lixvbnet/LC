## [69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)


Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return _the square root of_ `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and only **the integer part** of the result is returned.

**Note: **You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

*   <code>0 <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>

```go
func mySqrt(x int) int {
    l, r := 0, x
    for l <= r {
        m := l + (r - l) / 2
        square := m * m
        if square == x {
            return m
        } else if square < x {
            l = m + 1
        } else {
            r = m - 1
        }
    }

    // End Condition: l > r (return smaller one)
    return r
}
```

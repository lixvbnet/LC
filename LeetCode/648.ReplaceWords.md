## [648. Replace Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words/)


In English, we have a concept called **root**, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word **derivative**. For example, when the **root** `"help"` is followed by the word `"ful"`, we can form a derivative `"helpful"`.

Given a `dictionary` consisting of many **roots** and a `sentence` consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the **root** forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one **root**, replace it with the **root** that has **the shortest length**.

Return _the `sentence`_ after the replacement.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"
Output: "a a b c"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100`
*   `dictionary[i]` consists of only lower-case letters.
*   <code>1 <= sentence.length <= 10<sup>6</sup></code>
*   `sentence` consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.
*   The number of words in `sentence` is in the range `[1, 1000]`
*   The length of each word in `sentence` is in the range `[1, 1000]`
*   Every two consecutive words in `sentence` will be separated by exactly one space.
*   `sentence` does not have leading or trailing spaces.



## Solution

- HashSet

```go
func replaceWords(dictionary []string, sentence string) string {
    dictSet := make(map[string]bool)
    for _, s := range dictionary {
        dictSet[s] = true
    }

    words := strings.Split(sentence, " ")
    for i, word := range words {
        // if a substr of word is in the dict
        for j := range word {
            substr := word[:j+1]
            if dictSet[substr] {
                words[i] = substr
                break
            }
        }
    }
    return strings.Join(words, " ")
}
```



- Trie

```go
func replaceWords(dictionary []string, sentence string) string {
    t := NewTrie()
    for _, s := range dictionary {
        t.Insert(s)
    }
    
    words := strings.Split(sentence, " ")
    for i, word := range words {
        words[i] = t.ShortestRoot(word)
    }
    return strings.Join(words, " ")
}


type Trie struct {
    isEnd bool
    children [26]*Trie
}

func NewTrie() *Trie {
    return &Trie{}
}

func (t *Trie) Insert(word string) {
    cur := t
    for _, c := range word {
        c -= 'a'
        if cur.children[c] == nil {
            cur.children[c] = NewTrie()
        }
        cur = cur.children[c]
    }
    cur.isEnd = true
}

func (t *Trie) ShortestRoot(word string) string {
    cur := t
    for i, c := range word {
        c -= 'a'
        if cur.children[c] == nil {
            return word
        }
        cur = cur.children[c]
        if cur.isEnd {
            return word[:i+1]
        }
    }
    return word
}
```

## [123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/)


You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>



## Prerequisites

1. Only allow to buy and sell **twice**. (Two Transactions at most)
2. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time.



## Note

⚠️ It might be intriguing to try finding two longest increasing subarrays and get sum profits, **but it is wrong!** Consider [**1**,2,4,  2,5,**7**,  **2**,4,**9**,  0] , to get maximum profit, the correct answer is to buy at price **1** and sell at **7** , then buy at price **2** and sell at **9** , without total profit of ***13*** . (**That said, a transaction could go acoss one or more increasing subarrays in order to achieve maximum profit**.)



## Solution

- DP

> Let `buy1`, `sell1`, `buy2`, `sell2` represent the **max profits** of the four states.

```go
func maxProfit(prices []int) int {
	buy1, sell1 := -prices[0], 0
	buy2, sell2 := -prices[0], 0

	for i := 1; i < len(prices); i++ {
		// max profits by previous day
		buy1_pre := buy1
		sell1_pre := sell1
		buy2_pre := buy2
		sell2_pre := sell2

		buy1 = max(buy1_pre, -prices[i])
		sell1 = max(sell1_pre, buy1_pre+prices[i])
		buy2 = max(buy2_pre, sell1_pre-prices[i])
		sell2 = max(sell2_pre, buy2_pre+prices[i])
	}
	return sell2
}

func max(x, y int) int {
	if x > y {
		return x
	}
	return y
}
```

To achieve maximum profit, we "buy low, and sell high". That is, we won't buy and sell on the same day, as it simply "wastes" an operation and  brings no extra benefit. So when calulating `sell1`, for example, we can directly use `buy1` on the same day. Same for `buy2` and `sell2`. Code becomes more elegant.

```go
func maxProfit(prices []int) int {
	buy1, sell1 := -prices[0], 0
	buy2, sell2 := -prices[0], 0

	for i := 1; i < len(prices); i++ {
		buy1 = max(buy1, -prices[i])
		sell1 = max(sell1, buy1+prices[i])
		buy2 = max(buy2, sell1-prices[i])
		sell2 = max(sell2, buy2+prices[i])
	}
	return sell2
}

func max(x, y int) int {
	if x > y {
		return x
	}
	return y
}
```

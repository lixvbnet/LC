## [1392. Longest Happy Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-happy-prefix/)


A string is called a **happy prefix** if is a **non-empty** prefix which is also a suffix (excluding itself).

Given a string `s`, return _the **longest happy prefix** of_ `s`. Return an empty string `""` if no such prefix exists.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "level"
Output: "l"
Explanation: s contains 4 prefix excluding itself ("l", "le", "lev", "leve"), and suffix ("l", "el", "vel", "evel"). The largest prefix which is also suffix is given by "l".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ababab"
Output: "abab"
Explanation: "abab" is the largest prefix which is also suffix. They can overlap in the original string.
```

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.



## Solution

- KMP (Prefix function only)	$Time: O(n), Space: O(n)$

```go
func longestPrefix(s string) string {
    n := len(s)
    p := make([]int, n)
    for i, j := 1, 0; i < n; i++ {
        for j > 0 && s[i] != s[j] {
            j = p[j-1]
        }
        if s[i] == s[j] {
            j++
        }
        p[i] = j
    }
    return s[:p[n-1]]
}

## [371. Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)


Given two integers `a` and `b`, return _the sum of the two integers without using the operators_ `+` _and_ `-`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

*   `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`



## Solution

Bit matrix for adding two bits:

| bit a | bit b | Sum without carry (XOR) | Carry (AND) |
| :---: | :---: | :---------------------: | :---------: |
|   0   |   0   |            0            |   0 << 1    |
|   0   |   1   |            1            |   0 << 1    |
|   1   |   0   |            1            |   0 << 1    |
|   1   |   1   |            0            |   1 << 1    |

This rule also applies to adding two integers. And the implementation is similar to GCD (Greatest Common Divisor).

> sum without carry: `a ^ b` 
>
> carry:  `(a & b) << 1`

> a + b = `sum without carry` + `carry` . If carry == 0, then a is the result.

```go
func getSum(a int, b int) int {
    for b != 0 {
        carry := (a & b) << 1
        a, b = a^b, carry
    }
    return a
}
```

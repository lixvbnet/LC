## [338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)


Given an integer `n`, return _an array_ `ans` _of length_ `n + 1` _such that for each_ `i`(`0 <= i <= n`)_,_ `ans[i]` _is the **number of**_`1`_**'s** in the binary representation of_ `i`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
```

**Constraints:**

*   <code>0 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>

**Follow up:**

*   It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
*   Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++)?



## Solution

- Approach 1

> Last bit of an odd number is 1, and an even number 0.
>
> An odd number has one more "1" (last bit) than its previous even number.
>
> An even number has the same number of "1"s when its ending "0" is "cut out".

```go
func countBits(n int) []int {
	result := make([]int, n+1)
	result[0] = 0
	for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
		if i % 2 == 1 {
			result[i] = result[i-1] + 1
		} else {
			result[i] = result[i>>1]
		}
	}
	return result
}
```

- Approach 2

> `i&(i-1)` zeros out last "1" bit in `i` .

```go
func countBits(n int) []int {
	result := make([]int, n+1)
	result[0] = 0
	for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
		result[i] = result[i&(i-1)] + 1
	}
	return result
}
```

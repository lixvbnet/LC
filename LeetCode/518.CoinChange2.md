## [518. Coin Change 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-2/)


You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the number of combinations that make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= coins.length <= 300`
*   `1 <= coins[i] <= 5000`
*   All the values of `coins` are **unique**.
*   `0 <= amount <= 5000`



## Solution

- Dynamic Programming

```go
// M(i, j): number of combinations that make up amount j using coins[0...i]
// M(i, 0) = 1
// M(i, j) = M(i-1, j)    +   M(i, j-coins[i])
//       not use coins[i]   use one coins[i] then decide again whether to use coins[i]
func change(amount int, coins []int) int {
    dp := make([]int, amount+1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for _, coin := range coins {
        for j := 1; j <= amount; j++ {
            if j >= coin {
                dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j-coin]
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[amount]
}
```

Simplify the inner loop:

```go
// M(i, j): number of combinations that make up amount j using coins[0...i]
// M(i, 0) = 1
// M(i, j) = M(i-1, j)    +   M(i, j-coins[i])
//       not use coins[i]   use one coins[i] then decide again whether to use coins[i]
func change(amount int, coins []int) int {
    dp := make([]int, amount+1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for _, coin := range coins {
        for j := coin; j <= amount; j++ {
            dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j-coin]
        }
    }
    return dp[amount]
}
```

## [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)


Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range <code>[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
*   <code>-10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?



## Solution

- HashMap:	$Space: O(n)$ 

```go
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * type ListNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Next *ListNode
 * }
 */
func hasCycle(head *ListNode) bool {
    seen := make(map[*ListNode]bool)
    for p := head; p != nil; p = p.Next {
        if seen[p] {
            return true
        }
        seen[p] = true
    }
    return false
}
```

- Fast & Slow Pointers:	$Space: O(1)$ 

> Note: `slow` and `fast` pointers will certainly meet at somewhere in the cycle (if it has one), but the meet point is ***not necessarily*** the node where the cycle begins.

```go
func hasCycle(head *ListNode) bool {
	slow, fast := head, head
	for fast != nil && fast.Next != nil {
		slow = slow.Next
		fast = fast.Next.Next
		if slow == fast {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}
```

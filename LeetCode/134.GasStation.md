## [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)


There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> station to its next <code>(i + 1)<sup>th</sup></code> station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**

```
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   <code>1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>



## Solution

> Idea: Greedy. If we can travel from station `x` to `y` but can't get to next station `y+1` . Then we need to prove that from any station $z \in [x, y]$ , we can't get to station `y+1`. ( See [proof](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/solution/jia-you-zhan-by-leetcode-solution/) )

```go
func canCompleteCircuit(gas []int, cost []int) int {
    var start int
    var tank, sum int
    
    for i := range gas {
        net := gas[i] - cost[i]
        tank += net
        sum += net
        if tank < 0 {        // can't get to next station. Restart from next station.
            start = i + 1
            tank = 0
        }
    }
    
    if sum < 0 {
        return -1
    }
    return start
}
```

**Another Proof:**

Let `A` be an array such that `A[i] = gas[i] - cost[i]` . Then we have

- $\sum_{i=x}^y A[i] < 0$                                      (a)      ( Can't get to next station `y+1` from station `x` )
- For any $j \in [x, y]$ , $\sum_{i=x}^j A[i] \ge 0$     (b)      ( Can travel from `x` to any station $j \in [x, y]$ )

For a station $z \in [x, y]$ ,

$\sum_{i=z}^y A[i]  =  \sum_{i=x}^y  -  \sum_{i=x}^z$ 

​                  $<   0 - \sum_{i=x}^z$          	(a)

​                  $< 0$ 				(b)

Therefore, we can't get to next station `y+1` from any station $z \in [x, y]$

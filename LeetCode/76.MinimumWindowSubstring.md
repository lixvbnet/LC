## [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)


Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window substring** of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window. If there is no such substring__, return the empty string_ `""`_._

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == s.length`
*   `n == t.length`
*   <code>1 <= m, n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?



## Solution

- Sliding Window	$Time: O(n), Space: O(|\sum|)$ 

> Extend the window if it's invalid, and shrink if valid.

```go
func minWindow(s string, t string) string {
    if s == "" || t == "" || len(s) < len(t) {
        return ""
    }

    count, countT := make(map[byte]int), make(map[byte]int)
    for i := range t {
        countT[t[i]]++
    }
    
    resLeft, resRight := -1, len(s)
    // # of letters needed, and # of letters currently have
    need, have := len(countT), 0
    l, r := 0, 0
    for r <= len(s) {
        if have < need {
            // extend the window
            if r < len(s) {
                c := s[r]
                count[c]++
                if count[c] == countT[c] {
                    have++
                }
            }
            r++
        } else {
            // shrink the window
            if r-l < resRight-resLeft {
                resLeft, resRight = l, r
            }
            c := s[l]
            count[c]--
            if count[c] < countT[c] {
                have--
            }
            l++
        }
    }

    if resLeft == -1 {
        return ""
    }
    return s[resLeft:resRight]
}
```

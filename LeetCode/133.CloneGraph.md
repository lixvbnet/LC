## [133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)


Given a reference of a node in a undirected graph.

Return a (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List <node>neighbors;
}</node> 
```

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `Node.val` is unique for each node.
*   There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
*   The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.



## Solution

- DFS	$Time: O(n), Space: O(n)$ 

```go
/**
 * Definition for a Node.
 * type Node struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Neighbors []*Node
 * }
 */

func cloneGraph(node *Node) *Node {
    // map: old -> new
    m := make(map[*Node]*Node)
    return clone(node, m)
}

func clone(node *Node, m map[*Node]*Node) *Node {
    if node == nil {
        return nil
    }
    if m[node] != nil {
        return m[node]
    }

    newNode := &Node{Val: node.Val}
    m[node] = newNode
    for _, nei := range node.Neighbors {
        newNode.Neighbors = append(newNode.Neighbors, clone(nei, m))
    }
    return newNode
}
```



- BFS	$Time: O(n), Space: O(n)$ 

```go
func cloneGraph(node *Node) *Node {
	if node == nil {
		return nil
	}

	// map: old -> new
	m := make(map[*Node]*Node)

	// add first node to queue
	queue := []*Node{node}
	m[node] = &Node{Val: node.Val}

	for len(queue) > 0 {
		// pop a node
		n := queue[0]
		queue = queue[1:]

		for _, nei := range n.Neighbors {
			if m[nei] == nil {
				m[nei] = &Node{Val: nei.Val}
				queue = append(queue, nei)
			}
			m[n].Neighbors = append(m[n].Neighbors, m[nei])
		}
	}

	return m[node]
}
```

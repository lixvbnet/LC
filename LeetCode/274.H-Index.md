## [274. H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)


Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> paper, return _the researcher's h-index_.

According to the : The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`



## Solution

- Approach 1: Sort, $Time: O(nlogn), Space: O(n)$ 

```go
func hIndex(citations []int) int {
    sort.Ints(citations)
    n := len(citations)
    
    var i = 0
    for i < n && citations[n-1-i] > i {
        i++
    }
    return i
}
```



- Approach 2: Counting Sort, $Time: O(n), Space: O(n)$ 

```go
func hIndex(citations []int) int {
	n := len(citations)

	// counting sort
	count := make([]int, n+1)
	for _, v := range citations {
		if v > n {
			v = n
		}
		count[v]++
	}

	var y = n
	var sum = count[n]
	for y > sum {
		y--
		sum += count[y]
	}
	return y
}
```

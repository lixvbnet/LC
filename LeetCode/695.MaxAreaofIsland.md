## [695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)


You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 50`
*   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.



## Solution

- DFS

```go
func maxAreaOfIsland(grid [][]int) int {
    m, n := len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited := make([][]bool, m)
    for i := range visited {
        visited[i] = make([]bool, n)
    }
    
    var dfs func(int, int) int
    dfs = func(i, j int) int {
        if i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n || visited[i][j] || grid[i][j] == 0 {
            return 0
        }
        visited[i][j] = true
        return 1 + dfs(i-1, j) + dfs(i+1, j) + dfs(i, j-1) + dfs(i, j+1)
    }
    
    maxArea := 0
    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            maxArea = max(maxArea, dfs(i, j))
        }
    }
    return maxArea
}
```

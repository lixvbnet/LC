## [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)


You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>



## Prerequisites

1. Only allow to buy and sell **once**. (Single Transaction)
2. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. (Of course! only one transaction.)



## Solution

- Two Pointers / Sliding Window

> Buy low, sell high. Walk the array, `i` always points to the lowest price so far.

```go
// P(j): max profit we can achieve when selling at day j
// Then P(j) = max{ 0, A[j] - A[i] }, where A[i] is the lowest price so far
// Solution: max{ P(j) }
func maxProfit(prices []int) int {
    maxP := 0
    i := 0          // i always points to the lowest price so far
    
    for j := range prices {
        profit := prices[j] - prices[i]
        if profit < 0 {
            i = j   // found new lowest price
        }
        maxP = max(maxP, profit)
    }
    
    return maxP
}

func max(x, y int) int {
    if x >= y {
        return x
    }
    return y
}
```

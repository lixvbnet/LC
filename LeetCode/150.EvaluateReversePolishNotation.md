## [150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)


Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in .

Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

**Note** that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
```

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= tokens.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.



## Solution

```go
func evalRPN(tokens []string) int {
    var stack []int
    for _, token := range tokens {
        intVal, err := strconv.Atoi(token)
        if err == nil {
            // push
            stack = append(stack, intVal)
        } else {
            // pop two operands, then push their result
            a, b := stack[len(stack)-2], stack[len(stack)-1]
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-2]
            switch token {
            case "+":
                stack = append(stack, a+b)
            case "-":
                stack = append(stack, a-b)
            case "*":
                stack = append(stack, a*b)
            case "/":
                stack = append(stack, a/b)
            }
        }
    }
    return stack[0]
}
```

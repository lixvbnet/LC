## [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)


You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `nums1.length == m + n`
*   `nums2.length == n`
*   `0 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `1 <= m + n <= 200`
*   <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

## Solution

- $Time: O(m+n), Space: O(m+n)$ 

```go
func merge(A []int, m int, B []int, n int) {
    result := make([]int, m+n)
    i, j, index := 0, 0, 0
    for i < m && j < n {
        if A[i] < B[j] {
            result[index] = A[i]
            i++
        } else {
            result[index] = B[j]
            j++
        }
        index++
    }
    
    for i < m {
        result[index] = A[i]
        i++; index++
    }
    for j < n {
        result[index] = B[j]
        j++; index++
    }
    copy(A, result)
}
```

- $Time: O(m+n), Space: O(1)$ 

```go
func merge(A []int, m int, B []int, n int) {
	i, j, index := m-1, n-1, m+n-1	// put larger ones to the end
	for i >= 0 && j >= 0 {
		if A[i] > B[j] {
			A[index] = A[i]
			i--
		} else {
			A[index] = B[j]
			j--
		}
		index--
	}
	
	for i >= 0 {
		A[index] = A[i]
		i--; index--
	}
	for j >= 0 {
		A[index] = B[j]
		j--; index--
	}
}
```

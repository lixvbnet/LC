## [222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)


Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to **[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and <code>2<sup>h</sup></code> nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/complete.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[0, 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
*   <code>0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.



## Solution

- DFS	$Time: O(n), Space: O(n)$ 

```go
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * type TreeNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Left *TreeNode
 *     Right *TreeNode
 * }
 */
func countNodes(root *TreeNode) int {
    if root == nil {
        return 0
    }
    return 1 + countNodes(root.Left) + countNodes(root.Right)
}
```



- Binary Search	$Time: O(log^2{n}), Space: O(1)$ 

Note it is **Complete Binary Tree**. Suppose tree depth is d (0-based), then previous (d-1) levels have (2^d - 1) nodes, and last level has [1...2^d] nodes.

```go
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * type TreeNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Left *TreeNode
 *     Right *TreeNode
 * }
 */
func countNodes(root *TreeNode) int {
    if root == nil {
        return 0
    }
    // calculate depth
    d := -1
    for p := root; p != nil; p = p.Left {
        d++
    }
    // binary search last level to find first non-existing node position
    k := sort.Search(1<<d, func(i int) bool {
        return !exists(root, i, d)
    })
    // previous (d-1) levels have (2^d - 1) nodes, and last level has k nodes
    return 1<<d - 1 + k
}

// Check if last-level node at index exists [0...2^d)
func exists(root *TreeNode, index int, d int) bool {
    left, right := 0, 1<<d
    p := root
    // move down d steps from root
    for i := 0; i < d; i++ {
        mid := (left+right)/2
        if mid > index {
            p = p.Left
            right = mid
        } else {
            p = p.Right
            left = mid+1
        }
    }
    return p != nil
}
```

## [213. House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)


You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`



## Solution

> This problem is an extention of [198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/) .

```go
func rob(nums []int) int {
    n := len(nums)
    if n == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    if n == 1 {
        return nums[0]
    }
    if n == 2 {
        return max(nums[0], nums[1])
    }
    return max(helper(nums[:n-1]), helper(nums[1:]))
}

// LC198-rob function
// M(i): maximum amount of money can be robbed from A[0...i]
// M(0) = A[0], M(1) = max{A[0], A[1]}
// M(i) = max{ A[i]+M(i-2), M(i-1) }   , i >= 2
//             rob i       not rob i
// Solution: M(n-1)
func helper(nums []int) int {
    n := len(nums)
    pre, cur := 0, 0
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        pre, cur = cur, max(nums[i]+pre, cur)
    }
    return cur
}

func max(x, y int) int {
    if x > y {
        return x
    }
    return y
}
```

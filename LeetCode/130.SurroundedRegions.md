## [130. Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/)


You are given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing **letters** `'X'` and `'O'`, **capture regions** that are **surrounded**:

*   **Connect**: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
*   **Region**: To form a region **connect every** `'O'` cell.
*   **Surround**: The region is surrounded with `'X'` cells if you can **connect the region** with `'X'` cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the `board`.

A **surrounded region is captured** by replacing all `'O'`s with `'X'`s in the input matrix `board`.

**Example 1:**


**Input:** <span class="example-io" style="display: inline;">board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io" style="display: inline;">[["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]</span>

**Explanation:**

In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.


**Example 2:**


**Input:** <span class="example-io" style="display: inline;">board = [["X"]]</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io" style="display: inline;">[["X"]]</span>


**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.



## Idea

**Reverse Thinking**: Look for `'O'`s that are connected to the boarder and mark them. Change other `'O'`s to `'X'`, and then change the marked ones back.



## Solution

```go
func solve(board [][]byte)  {
    m, n := len(board), len(board[0])

    var dfs func(i, j int)
    dfs = func(i, j int) {
        if i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n || board[i][j] != 'O' {
            return
        }
        board[i][j] = 'B'
        dfs(i+1, j)
        dfs(i-1, j)
        dfs(i, j+1)
        dfs(i, j-1)
    }

    // mark as 'B' every 'O' that is connected to the border
    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        dfs(i, 0)       // first column
        dfs(i, n-1)     // last column
    }
    for j := 1; j < n-1; j++ {
        dfs(0, j)       // first row
        dfs(m-1, j)     // last row
    }

    // change unmarked cells to 'X', and change marked cells back to 'O'
    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            if board[i][j] == 'O' {
                board[i][j] = 'X'
            } else if board[i][j] == 'B' {
                board[i][j] = 'O'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

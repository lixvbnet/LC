## [236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)


Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the : “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[2, 10<sup>5</sup>]</code>.
*   <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
*   `p != q`
*   `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.



## Solution

- Approach1:	$Time: O(n), Space: O(H)$ 

```go
func lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q *TreeNode) *TreeNode {
	var result *TreeNode
	contains(root, p, q, &result)
	return result
}

// test if tree root contains at least one of node p and node q
func contains(root, p, q *TreeNode, result **TreeNode) bool {
	if root == nil {
		return false
	}

	leftContains := contains(root.Left, p, q, result)
	rightCotains := contains(root.Right, p, q, result)
	isCurrentNode := (root == p || root == q)

	// p, q on two sides  OR  one is just current node, another in either side
	if (leftContains && rightCotains) || (isCurrentNode && (leftContains || rightCotains)) {
		*result = root
	}
	return leftContains || rightCotains || isCurrentNode
}
```

> ⚠️ This approch relies on the given condition "`p` and `q` will exist in the tree." Suppose `p` or `q` is not even in the tree, the function will return a non-nil result anyway.
>
> - If `p` and `q` both exist, return their Lowest Common Ancestor
> - If only one exists, return that one
> - If neither of `p` , `q` exists, return `nil` 

```go
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * type TreeNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Left *TreeNode
 *     Right *TreeNode
 * }
 */
func lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q *TreeNode) *TreeNode {
    if root == nil || root == p || root == q {
        return root
    }
    
    left := lowestCommonAncestor(root.Left, p, q)
    right := lowestCommonAncestor(root.Right, p, q)
    
    if left != nil && right != nil {
        return root
    }
    if left != nil {
        return left
    } else {
        return right
    }
}

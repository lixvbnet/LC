## [424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)


You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
*   `0 <= k <= s.length`



## Solution

- Sliding Window	$Time: O(n), Space: O(|\sum|)$ 

```go
func characterReplacement(s string, k int) int {
    result := 0
    // In window [i, j], total number of characters - maxCnt <= k
    var count [26]int
    i := 0
    for j := range s {
        ch := s[j] - 'A'
        count[ch]++
        
        maxCnt := 0
        for k := 0; k < len(count); k++ {
            maxCnt = max(maxCnt, count[k])
        }

        if j-i+1 - maxCnt > k {
            count[s[i]-'A']--
            i++
        }
        result = max(result, j-i+1)
    }
    return result
}

func max(x, y int) int {
    if x > y {
        return x
    }
    return y
}
```

Actually, we can maintain an extra `maxCnt` variable. Although it might be larger than actual maxCnt when shrinking the window by incrementing left pointer, it will not affect the result.

**Requirement**: In window [i, j], total number of characters - maxCnt <= k

- The window would never shrink in size, since its right index `j` is always incrementing.
- Current window would not necessarily always meet the requirement, but its size is always equal to the size of by far maximum window that meets the requirement.

```go
func characterReplacement(s string, k int) int {
    // In window [i, j], total number of characters - maxCnt <= k
    var count [26]int
    maxCnt := 0
    i := 0
    for j := range s {
        ch := s[j] - 'A'
        count[ch]++
        maxCnt = max(maxCnt, count[ch])    
        if j-i+1 - maxCnt > k {
            count[s[i]-'A']--
            i++
        }
    }
    return len(s)-i
}

func max(x, y int) int {
    if x > y {
        return x
    }
    return y
}
```

## [417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/)


There is an `m x n` rectangular island that borders both the **Pacific Ocean** and **Atlantic Ocean**. The **Pacific Ocean** touches the island's left and top edges, and the **Atlantic Ocean** touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the **height above sea level** of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is **less than or equal to** the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return _a **2D list** of grid coordinates_ `result` _where_ <code>result[i] = [r<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, c<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]</code> _denotes that rain water can flow from cell_ <code>(r<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, c<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>)</code> _to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/waterflow-grid.jpg)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
Explanation: The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
[0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
[4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [[1]]
Output: [[0,0]]
Explanation: The water can flow from the only cell to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == heights.length`
*   `n == heights[r].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   <code>0 <= heights[r][c] <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>



## Idea

DFS or BFS **starting from the ocean (i.e. the four borders)** 



## Solution

- DFS

```go
func pacificAtlantic(heights [][]int) [][]int {
    m, n := len(heights), len(heights[0])
    pac := make([][]bool, m)
    atl := make([][]bool, m)
    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        pac[i] = make([]bool, n)
        atl[i] = make([]bool, n)
    }

    var dfs func(int, int, int, [][]bool)
    dfs = func(i, j int, preHeight int, visited [][]bool) {
        if i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n {
            return
        }
        h := heights[i][j]
        if h < preHeight {
            return
        }
        if visited[i][j] {
            return
        }
        visited[i][j] = true
        dfs(i-1, j, h, visited)
        dfs(i+1, j, h, visited)
        dfs(i, j-1, h, visited)
        dfs(i, j+1, h, visited)
    }

    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        dfs(i, 0, 0, pac)
        dfs(i, n-1, 0, atl)
    }
    for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
        dfs(0, j, 0, pac)
        dfs(m-1, j, 0, atl)
    }

    var res [][]int
    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            if pac[i][j] && atl[i][j] {
                res = append(res, []int{i, j})
            }
        }
    }
    return res
}
```

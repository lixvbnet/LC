## [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)


You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == height.length`
*   <code>2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>0 <= height[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>



## Solution

- Two Pointers / Greedy: $Time: O(n)$ 

> Start from largest width, and always move the shorter one.

```go
// Two pointers: start from largest width, and always move the shorter one.
func maxArea(height []int) int {
    result := 0
    n := len(height)
    
    i, j := 0, n-1
    for i < j {
        S := (j-i) * min(height[i], height[j])
        result = max(result, S)
        // move the shorter one
        if height[i] < height[j] {
            i++
        } else {
            j--
        }
    }
    return result
}

func max(x, y int) int {
    if x > y {
        return x
    }
    return y
}

func min(x, y int) int {
    if x < y {
        return x
    }
    return y
}
```

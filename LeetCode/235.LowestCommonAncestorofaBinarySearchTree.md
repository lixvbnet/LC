## [235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)


Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the : “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[2, 10<sup>5</sup>]</code>.
*   <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
*   `p != q`
*   `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.



## Solution

- Recursion:	$Time: O(n), Space: O(H)$ 

```go
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * type TreeNode struct {
 *     Val   int
 *     Left  *TreeNode
 *     Right *TreeNode
 * }
 */

func lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q *TreeNode) *TreeNode {
    if p.Val < root.Val && q.Val < root.Val {
        return lowestCommonAncestor(root.Left, p, q)
    } else if p.Val > root.Val && q.Val > root.Val {
        return lowestCommonAncestor(root.Right, p, q)
    } else {
        return root
    }
}
```

- Iterative:	$Time: O(n), Space: O(1)$ 

```go
func lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q *TreeNode) *TreeNode {
    ancestor := root
    for {
        if p.Val < ancestor.Val && q.Val < ancestor.Val {
            ancestor = ancestor.Left
        } else if p.Val > ancestor.Val && q.Val > ancestor.Val {
            ancestor = ancestor.Right
        } else {
            return ancestor
        }
    }
}
```

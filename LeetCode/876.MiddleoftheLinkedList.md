## [876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)


Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return _the middle node of the linked list_.

If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle** node.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 100`



## Solution

- Approach 1

> First pass calculate list length `n`. Second pass walk `n/2` steps.
>
> This problem prefers right node when there is a tie. But if it prefers left, then we should walk `(n-1)/2` steps.

```go
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * type ListNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Next *ListNode
 * }
 */
func middleNode(head *ListNode) *ListNode {
    n := 0
    for p := head; p != nil; p = p.Next {
        n++
    }
    
    p := head
    for i := 0; i < n/2; i++ {
        p = p.Next
    }
    return p
}
```

- Slow & Fast Pointers

> Let `slow` pointer traverse the list while `fast` pointer traverse twice as fast. When `fast` reaches end of list, `slow` is in the middle.
>
> This problem prefers right node when there is a tie. But if it prefers left, then the loop condition should be changed to `for fast.Next != nil && fast.Next.Next != nil` ***OR*** let `fast` pointer start from `head.Next` .

```go
func middleNode(head *ListNode) *ListNode {
    if head == nil {
        return head
    }
    
    slow, fast := head, head
    for fast != nil && fast.Next != nil {
        slow = slow.Next
        fast = fast.Next.Next
    }
    return slow
}
```

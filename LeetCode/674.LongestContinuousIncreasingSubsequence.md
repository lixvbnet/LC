## [674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/)


Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest **continuous increasing subsequence** (i.e. subarray)_. The subsequence must be **strictly** increasing.

A **continuous increasing subsequence** is defined by two indices `l` and `r` (`l < r`) such that it is `[nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]]` and for each `l <= i < r`, `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly
increasing.
```

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>



## Prerequisites

- The subsequence must be **strictly** increasing. (So here we consider `A[j]==A[j-1]` as decreasing to break the tie.)



## Solution

- Two Points / Sliding Window

> ⚠️ **Calculate *maxSoFar* continuously.** This makes code clean and tidy.
>
> `i` always points to lowest value of current `CIS [l...r]` .
>
> - when increasing, keep extending right boundary `r` .
> - when decreasing, reset `l` to equal to `r` , so that current CIS only contain one element.

```go
func findLengthOfLCIS(nums []int) int {
    result := 1

    l := 0
    for r := 1; r < len(nums); r++ {
        if nums[r] > nums[r-1] {
            result = max(result, r-l+1)
        } else {
            l = r
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

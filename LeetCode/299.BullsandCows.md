## [299. Bulls and Cows](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulls-and-cows/)


You are playing the game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

*   The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
*   The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB"`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1807"
  |
"7810"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
Output: "1A1B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1123"        "1123"
  |      or     |
"0111"        "0111"
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`
*   `secret.length == guess.length`
*   `secret` and `guess` consist of digits only.



## Solution

> Idea: Use `+1` to mark digit occurrence in `secret` , and `-1` in `guess` .

```go
func getHint(secret string, guess string) string {
    var A, B int

    var count [10]int
    for i := range secret {
        s, g := secret[i]-'0', guess[i]-'0'
        if s == g {
            A++
        } else {
            if count[s] < 0 {   // current digit in secret already seen in guest
                B++
            }
            if count[g] > 0 {   // current digit in guest already seen in secret
                B++
            }
            count[s]++  // use +1 to mark digit occurrence in secret
            count[g]--  // use -1 to mark digit occurrence in guess
        }
    }

    return strconv.Itoa(A) + "A" + strconv.Itoa(B) + "B"
}
```

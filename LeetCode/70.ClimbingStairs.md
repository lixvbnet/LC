## [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)


You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 45`



## Solution

- Dynamic Programming	$Time: O(n), Space: O(1)$ 

```go
// M(i): # of distinct ways to climb i steps
// M(0) = 1
// M(i) = M(i-1) + M(i-2), i > 0
func climbStairs(n int) int {
    x, y := 1, 1
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        x, y = y, x+y
    }
    return x
}
```

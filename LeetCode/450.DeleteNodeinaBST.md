## [450. Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/)


Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1.  Search for a node to remove.
2.  If the node is found, delete the node.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/04/del_node_1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
*   <code>-10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   Each node has a **unique** value.
*   `root` is a valid binary search tree.
*   <code>-10<sup>5</sup> <= key <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>

**Follow up:** Could you solve it with time complexity `O(height of tree)`?



## Solution

```go
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * type TreeNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Left *TreeNode
 *     Right *TreeNode
 * }
 */
func deleteNode(root *TreeNode, key int) *TreeNode {
    if root == nil {
        return nil
    }

    if key == root.Val {
        if root.Right == nil {
            return root.Left
        }
        // find leftmost node of right subtree and insert left subtree
        p := root.Right
        for p.Left != nil {
            p = p.Left
        }
        p.Left = root.Left
        return root.Right
    }

    if key < root.Val {
        root.Left = deleteNode(root.Left, key)
    } else {
        root.Right = deleteNode(root.Right, key)
    }
    return root
}
```

## [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)


Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
*   All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.



## Solution

- Binary Search: $Time: O(logn)$ 

> Split the array into two sorted subarrays, and the min value is the first element of the second subarray. Determine Search Condition by comparing to rightmost value in current range.
>
> Note in the for loop, the `target` (min value) is **always inside** the range `[l, r]` in each round. So if it ever reaches a state that the subarray `A[l...r]` is sorted, `A[l...r]` must be in the second sorted subarray and `A[l]` is the min value.

```go
func findMin(nums []int) int {
    l, r := 0, len(nums)-1
    for l < r {
        // if already sorted, nums[l] is min value
        if nums[l] < nums[r] {
            return nums[l]
        }

        m := l + (r - l) / 2
        if nums[m] < nums[r] {  // nums[m] is in second sorted subarray
            r = m       // inclusive since min value is also in second sorted subarray
        } else {                // nums[m] is in first sorted subarray
            l = m+1     // exclusive since min value is NOT in first sorted subarray
        }
    }
    
    // End Condition: l == r
    return nums[l]  // after for loop, l and r both point to min value (l == r)
}
```

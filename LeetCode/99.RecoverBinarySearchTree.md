## [99. Recover Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/)


You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of **exactly** two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. _Recover the tree without changing its structure_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
*   <code>-2<sup>31</sup> <= Node.val <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>

**Follow up:** A solution using `O(n)` space is pretty straight-forward. Could you devise a constant `O(1)` space solution?



## Solution

> Inorder Traversal of a BST results in an array sorted in ascending order. So we can find the two (or one) "dropping" point(s) when traversing the given tree. Examples:
>
> - Two "dropping" points: [1, `5`, 3, 4, `2`, 6]
> - One "dropping" points: [1, `3`, `2`, 4]



- Inorder Traversal (Recursive)	$Time: O(n), Space: O(logn)$ or $O(n)$ depending on tree height

```go
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * type TreeNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Left *TreeNode
 *     Right *TreeNode
 * }
 */
func recoverTree(root *TreeNode) {
    var pre, target1, target2 *TreeNode
    var inorder func(root *TreeNode)
    inorder = func(root *TreeNode) {
        if root == nil {
            return
        }
        inorder(root.Left)
        if pre != nil && pre.Val > root.Val {
            // always set target2 to lower value "root".
            // cover the case when two targets are ajacent
            target2 = root
            if target1 == nil {
                target1 = pre
            }
        }
        pre = root
        inorder(root.Right)
    }

    inorder(root)
    target1.Val, target2.Val = target2.Val, target1.Val
}
```

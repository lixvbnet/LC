## [190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)


Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Note:**

*   Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
*   In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using . Therefore, in **Example 2** above, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`

## Solution

- Bit-by-bit Reverse:	$Time: O(logn)$ (In this problem, $O(logn) = O(32) = O(1)$ )

```go
func reverseBits(num uint32) uint32 {
    var res uint32
    for i := 0; i < 32; i++ {
        // get last bit of num
        lastBit := num & 1
        // left shift res and set last bit
        res = res<<1 | lastBit
        // right shift num
        num >>= 1
    }
    return res
}
```



- Bitwise Divide & Conquer (Bottom up):	$Time: O(1)$ 

> Bottom up the process of Divide & Conquer:
>
> - With 1 bit as a unit, swap units two by two
> - With 2 bits as a unit, swap units two by two
> - With 4 bits as a unit, swap units two by two
> - With 8 bits as a unit, swap units two by two
> - With 16 bits as a unit, there are only 2 two units, swap directly.

```go
const (
    m1 = 0x55555555 // 01010101010101010101010101010101
    m2 = 0x33333333 // 00110011001100110011001100110011
    m4 = 0x0f0f0f0f // 00001111000011110000111100001111
    m8 = 0x00ff00ff // 00000000111111110000000011111111
)

func reverseBits(n uint32) uint32 {
    n = n>>1&m1 | n&m1<<1
    n = n>>2&m2 | n&m2<<2
    n = n>>4&m4 | n&m4<<4
    n = n>>8&m8 | n&m8<<8
    return n>>16 | n<<16
}
```

> Go Standard Library is also using this approach ( `bits.Reverse32` )
>
> ```go
> func reverseBits(num uint32) uint32 {
> 	return bits.Reverse32(num)
> }
> ```



Note: The expressions used in each line (for retrieving two groups of bits) depend on the masks. For example, we can also use another set of masks and expressions:

```go
const (
    m1 = 0xAAAAAAAA // 1010 1010 ...
    m2 = 0xCCCCCCCC // 1100 1100 ...
    m4 = 0xF0F0F0F0 // 1111 0000 1111 0000 ...
    m8 = 0xFF00FF00 // 1111 1111 0000 0000 ...
)

func reverseBits(n uint32) uint32 {
	n = n<<1&m1 | n&m1>>1
	n = n<<2&m2 | n&m2>>2
	n = n<<4&m4 | n&m4>>4
	n = n<<8&m8 | n&m8>>8
	return n<<16 | n>>16
}
```

[My Brain after 569 Leetcode Problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wysIxzqgPI) (video from [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/))

1. Choose a non-verbose language (such as Golang, Python, etc.)
2. Solve by topics/tags. Do NOT solve in random order!
3. Do not waste too much time.
  (For a single problem, try at most 45-60min. Read others' solution if you can't solve)
4. Repetition (IMPORTANT!!)
